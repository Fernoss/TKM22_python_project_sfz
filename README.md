# Workplace Satisfaction Data Analysis

## Overview
This Python project focuses on the analysis of workplace satisfaction data collected from a survey. The goal is to gain insights into various factors that contribute to employee satisfaction in a given workplace. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, data cleaning, and visualization of key trends.

## Project Description
The project utilizes popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for efficient data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The data is loaded from an Excel file, and columns are renamed for clarity based on the explanations found in the original file.

## Data Exploration
The initial steps involve exploring the structure of the dataset, understanding variable types, and identifying any missing values. The project aims to ensure the dataset's integrity for meaningful analysis.

## Data Cleaning
To enhance the quality of the data, missing values are addressed by employing appropriate strategies. This includes filling missing values in numerical columns with their respective means, ensuring a more complete dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves creating various visualizations to explore relationships between different variables. An example is provided, where a horizontal bar chart is used to visualize the distribution of gender percentages in the dataset.

## Statistical Significance Test
The project explores the statistical significance of the dependence observed in cross-tabulation. The chi-square test (chi2_contingency) is utilized to calculate the p-value associated with cross-tabulation. The interpretation of the p-value is crucial in determining the significance of the dependence between education levels and genders.

## Next Steps
With the initial data exploration, cleaning, and EDA completed, the project has laid the groundwork for more in-depth analysis. Consider further exploring relationships between different variables, creating additional visualizations, and deriving insights to better understand the factors influencing workplace satisfaction.
